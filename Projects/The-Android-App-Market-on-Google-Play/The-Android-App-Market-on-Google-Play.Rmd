## **1. Google Play Store apps and reviewers**

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

Let's take a look at the data, which consists of two files:

- `apps.csv`: contains all the details of the applications in Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
- `users_reviewers.csv`: contains 100 reviewers for each app, [most helpful first](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/21/google-play-stores-redesigned-ratings-and-reviews-section-lets-you-easily-filter-by-star-rating/). The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

```{python}
# Read in dataset
import pandas as pd
apps_with_duplicates = pd.read_csv('datasets/apps.csv')

# Drop duplicates
apps = apps_with_duplicates.drop_duplicates()

# Print the total number of apps
print('Total number of apps in the dataset =', apps.count()[0])

# Print a concise summary of apps dataframe
print(apps.info())
```

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# Have a look at a random sample of n rows
n = 5
apps.sample(n)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Have a look at a random sample of n rows
apps <- read.csv('datasets/apps.csv')
apps <- apps %>%
        distinct()
n <- 5
apps %>% 
        sample_n(5)
```

## **2. Data cleaning**

The four features that we will be working with most frequently henceforth are `Installs`, `Size`, `Rating` and `Price`. The `info()` function (from the previous task) told us that `Installs` and `Price` columns area of type `object` and not `int64` as we would expect. This is because the columns contains some characters more than just [0,9] digits. Ideally, we would want these columns to be numeric as their name suggests. 
Hence, we now proceed to data cleaning and prepare our data to be consumed in our analysis later. Specifically, the presence of special characters (, $ +) in the `Installs` and `Price` columns make their conversion to a numerical data type difficult.

```{python}
# List of characters to remove
chars_to_remove = ['+', ',', '$']

# List of column names to clean
cols_to_clean = ['Installs', 'Price']

# Loop for each column
for col in cols_to_clean:
    # Replace each character with an empty string
    for char in chars_to_remove:
        apps[col] = apps[col].astype(str).str.replace(char, '')
    # Convert col to numeric
    apps[col] = pd.to_numeric(apps[col], downcast = 'float')
quit()
```

## **3. Exploring app categories**

With more than q billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important distribution platform to build a global audience. For businesses to get their apps in front of users,it's important to make them more quickly and easily discoverable on Google Play. To improve the overall search experience, Google has introduced the concept of grouping apps into categories.
This bring us to the following questions:

- Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
- Is any specific category dominating the market?
- Which categories have the fewest number of apps?

We will see that there area 33 unique app categories present in our dataset. *Family* and *Game* apps have the highest market prevalence. Interestingly, *Tool*, *Business*, and *Medical* apps are also at the top.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Print the total number of unique categories
num_categories = len(apps['Category'].unique())
print('Number of categories = ', num_categories)

# Count the number of apps in each 'Category' and sort them in descending order
num_apps_in_category = apps['Category'].value_counts(ascending = False)

plt.barh(y = num_apps_in_category.index, width = num_apps_in_category.values)
plt.xlabel('Count of Category')
plt.ylabel('App Category')
plt.show()
plt.clf()

```

## **4. Distribution of app ratings**

After having witnessed the market share for each category of apps, let's see how all these apps perform on an average. App rating (on a scale of 1 to 5) impact the discoverability, conversion of apps as well as the company's overall brand image. Ratings are a key performance indicator of an app.

From our research, we found that the average volume of ratings across all app categories is 4.19. The histogram plot is skewed to the left indicating that the majority of the apps are highly rated with only a few exceptions in the low-rated apps.

```{python}
# Average rating of apps
avg_app_rating = apps.Rating.mean().round(2)
print('Average app rating = ', avg_app_rating)

# Distribution of apps according to their ratings
apps.Rating.hist(bins = 100)
plt.xlim(0, 5)
plt.xlabel('Ratings')
plt.ylabel('Count of Ratings')
plt.show()
plt.clf()

```

## **5. Size and price of an app**

Let's now examine app size and app price. For size, if mobile app is too large, it may be difficult and/or expensive for users to download. Lengthy download times could turn users off before they even experience your mobile app. Plus, each user's device has a finite amount of disk space. For price, some users expect their apps to be free or inexpensive. These problems compound if the developing world is part of your target market; especially due to internet speeds ,earning power and exchange rates.

How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?

- Does the size of an app affect its rating? 
- Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
- Does the price of an app affect its rating?
- Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?

We find that the majority of top rated apps (rating over 4) range from 2 MB to 20 MB. We also find the vast majority of apps price themselves under $10.
