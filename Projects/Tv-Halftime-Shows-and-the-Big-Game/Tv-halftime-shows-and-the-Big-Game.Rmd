## **1. Tv, halftime shows, and the Big Game**

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the word, sometimes [riding giant mechanical tigers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD1QrIe--_Y&feature=youtu.be&t=14) or [leaping from the roof of the stadium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjrdywp5nyE&feature=youtu.be&t=62). It's a show, baby. And in this project, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning the data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset we'll used was [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and polished from Wikipedia. It awas made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings) and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls though 2018. Let's taka a look, using `display()` instead of `print()` since its output is prettier in Jupyter  Notebooks.

```{python}
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV data into DataFrames

#super_bowls = pd.read_csv()
```
